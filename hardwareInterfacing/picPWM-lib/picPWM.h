class picPWM {
    /* Class to control the PWM signals for the magnetorquers and reaction wheel motors
        This is specifically designed to interface with the PIC18 MicroChip MCUs

        Note that the various PWM devices will need to be connected to the proper pins on the MCU
        to ensure proper functionality of this software. This software uses the memory addresses 
        of the registers to control each PWM output.  If a different PWM module output is used for a
        given acutator, the address values stored in the various methods will need to be updated to reflect
        this change. It is recommended to leave this as is unless nessecary.
        
        The pin requirements are as follows:
        PIN     |   Actuator        |   PWM output
        =============================================
        RC4     |   Motor X         |   PWM3S1P1
        RC3     |   Motor Y         |   PWM3S1P2
        RC6     |   Magnetorquer X  |   PWM1S1P1
        RC7     |   Magnetorquer Y  |   PWM1S1P2
